# Data Engineering Pipeline Example

This repository contains an example of a data engineering pipeline implemented in Python. The pipeline demonstrates data ingestion, processing, error handling, monitoring, and alerting mechanisms.

## Overview

The data engineering pipeline consists of the following components:
- Data Ingestion: Implementation of scalable data ingestion from various sources (e.g., JSON, CSV, Avro) using Kafka.
- Data Processing: Transformation, validation, filtering, deduplication, and correlation of data using pandas.
- Data Storage and Query Performance: Selection of appropriate data storage solution (e.g., Amazon Redshift) and optimization for analytical queries.
- Error Handling and Monitoring: Error handling using try-except blocks and logging, monitoring pipeline performance metrics, and alerting mechanisms.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Kafka (for data ingestion)
- PostgreSQL or Amazon Redshift (for data storage)
